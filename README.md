# Fate Series GUIDE HTML/CSS/JS

All this files consist in a simple HTML page that contain a guide to watch the Fate Series.

I has planed to add a video player for the episodes and extend the number of seasons the page has.

If you want in the page "Contactanos" you can send your favorite serie for us to add it to the page.
